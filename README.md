# Ember Pirate

This is quite likely the only Ember CLI addon that can work even if you don't
add it to your dependencies.

Ember Pirate provides an `arr` helper that accepts as many positional
parameters as you want and returns a collection with them all.

# Installation

Ember Pirate can work even if you do not declare it as a dependency.

## Normal Installation

`ember install ember-pirate`

## Pirate Installation

`ember generate helper arr`
